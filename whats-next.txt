Ask Donn:
        Which parts of the report and code would he like to review?
        Are we missing anything?
        Specify final deliverables.
        Do blank pages count toward page count?
        Where does benchmarking and testing belong in the report?
                - How is it done in the theory section
                - Do we write specifically about timing methods in theory or methods?
        Which of the tests do we need (do you have any?)
        How to present 


Stuff:
        Further work: can memory management be faster if the kernel knows the program will only use an arena
                - Implement arena in kernel for kernel, not as a module
                - Implement arena module for use in other modules

Research code:
        Lagre alle allokeringstider
                - være bevist på hvordan skriving av timingen kan påvirke allokeringen
        Discarde de som er for store
        Scheduling + cache kommer til å påvirke
